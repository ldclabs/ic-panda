# dmsg

The dMsg command line client. `dmsg daemon` runs the daemon, the only process
that holds keys and state; every other command asks it over loopback. The
cryptography, storage and protocol logic live in
[`dmsg_client`](../dmsg_client/README.md).

## Home

`--home <dir>`, else `$DMSG_HOME`, else `~/.dmsg`:

| Path | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `config.toml` | Deployment parameters and policies; the only place to change them |
| `owner.token` | Owner credential with `secure_storage = "file"`, readable only by its owner |
| `daemon.json` | Port, process and instance ID of the running daemon |
| `dmsg-daemon.lock` | Held by the running daemon: one daemon per home |
| `<environment>/workspace.sqlite` | The device's workspace: encrypted versions and chunks, sealed records, sync jobs |

```toml
environment = "local"            # local, staging or production
ic_host = "http://127.0.0.1:4943"
relay = "http://127.0.0.1:8787"  # dmsg-cloud device API
handle = "<name registry canister>"
user_homes = ["<user home>"]     # optional pins; the registry is the authority
root_key = "<hex DER>"           # local only
login_url = "http://localhost:3002/_/login"  # local only; default https://dmsg.net/_/login
idle_lock_minutes = 15           # 1 to 1440
background_online = false        # keep the device key while locked
sync_interval_minutes = 0        # scheduled sync; 0 is off
secure_storage = "system"        # "system" (default on macOS and Windows) or "file"
```

Outside `local`, every URL must be HTTPS and `root_key`/`login_url` are refused.

`secure_storage = "system"` keeps the owner credential and the fast-unlock key
in the system credential store (Keychain, Credential Manager, Secret Service)
under the service `dmsg`. `"file"`, the default elsewhere, keeps the owner
credential in `owner.token`; fast unlock is then unavailable.

## Commands

```sh
dmsg daemon [--port N]           # foreground; port 0 (default) picks a free one
dmsg status [--json]
dmsg login [--origin dmsg.net|panda.fans] [--no-browser]
dmsg unlock [--fast] | lock | stop
dmsg fast-unlock enable | disable
dmsg account create | show
dmsg device list | pair-request [--member] | approve <request> --device <id>
dmsg vault add --title T [--type note|login|api|key] [--body B] [--username U] [--url L] [--tag T]... [--secret-stdin]
dmsg vault edit <id> [--title T] [--body B] [--username U] [--url L] [--tag T]... [--secret-stdin]
dmsg vault rm <id> | restore <id> | list [--trash] | search <text> | show <id> [--reveal]
dmsg vault conflicts | resolve <id:revision> [--keep-current]
dmsg file import <path> | list | get <id> -o <path> | verify <id>
dmsg sync | sync status
dmsg profile show | publish [--name N] [--bio B] [--link URL]... | resolve <account>
dmsg reset --yes
```

`--json` prints one JSON value per line; errors are `{"error": {"code", "message"}}`.
`dmsg status --json` prints `{"running": false}` and exits with 3 when no
daemon runs.

A new device: `login`, then `account create` for a new account, or
`device pair-request` and, on an administrator device,
`device approve <request> --device <id>`, which also rotates the content root
to the new device; `unlock` on the new device then binds it. Secrets leave the
daemon only with `vault show --reveal`; file keys never do.

Unlocking through a login opens the root and syncs once. Every write waits
for `dmsg sync` or the scheduled sync; `status` shows pending versions and
conflict copies. An edit that lost a race is kept as a conflict copy on every
device; `vault resolve` adopts it, or keeps the current version with
`--keep-current`. An item in the trash takes only `vault restore` (or
adopting a copy) back. `file import` resumes an interrupted import of the same
file; `file get` writes only a fully verified file to a path that does not
exist yet. `profile publish` publishes exactly the fields given. `reset`
erases the workspace, unsent versions included, and starts over as a new
device; a device its account revoked does this on its own.

## Daemon protocol

The daemon listens on `127.0.0.1` only.

- `GET /daemon/status` and `POST /app/v1` (JSON-RPC 2.0) need
  `Authorization: Bearer <owner token>`; any request with an `Origin` header
  is refused with 401. Errors carry `error.data.code` such as `AUTH_REQUIRED`,
  `LOCKED`, `VERSION_CONFLICT` or `EXECUTION_UNKNOWN`.
- Methods: `session/status|login|login_result|unlock|lock|fast_unlock`,
  `account/create|show`, `device/pair_request|approve`,
  `vault/put|edit|delete|restore|list|show|conflicts|resolve`,
  `file/import|export|verify` (absolute paths), `sync/run|status`,
  `profile/show|publish|resolve`, `workspace/reset`, `daemon/stop`.
- `GET /auth/callback` and `POST /auth/callback` exist only while a login is
  pending (ten minutes) and accept one POST from the daemon's own loopback
  origin ([dmsg-login/1](../../docs/protocol/login-v1_zh.md) §4).
- `idle_lock_minutes` without a request locks the daemon: the login and every
  key are dropped. Revisions already signed for submission are still sent,
  without any key, until their 45-second deadline. With `background_online`
  the device signing key stays: `dmsg sync` and the scheduled sync still send
  sealed versions and fetch ciphertext, while reading, editing and every
  account change answer `LOCKED`.
