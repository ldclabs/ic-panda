# DMSG Minter

**DMSG** is a meme coin on the ICP blockchain, fairly minted through the **[dMsg.net](https://dmsg.net)** Proof of Link (PoL), with a maximum supply of **41.99 million** tokens.

PoL rewards users for creating verified connections on dMsg.net, fostering genuine engagement and decentralization.

## How does Proof of Link (PoL) Work?

1. You must register a username to activate your dMsg.net profile page.
2. Minting begins when another user visits your profile and sends you a message.
3. Accepting the message request establishes a connection and completes the minting process, earning you mining rewards.
4. Only one reward is generated per unique connection between users.
5. Initial reward: **1 DMSG**, with rewards halving every **21'000'000** blocks.
6. Mining ends when rewards halve to **0.0001 DMSG** at block height **293'999'999**, capping total supply at **41'997'436.32 DMSG**.
7. No pre-mined DMSG—all tokens are generated through PoL mining.

Registering a username on dMsg.net costs a minimum of **100 PANDA**, and creating a message channel costs **10 PANDA**.
