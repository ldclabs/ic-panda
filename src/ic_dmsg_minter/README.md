# DMSG Minter

**DMSG** is a meme coin on the ICP blockchain, fairly minted through the **[dMsg.net](https://dmsg.net)** Proof of Link (PoL), with a maximum supply of **41.99 million** tokens.

PoL rewards users for creating verified connections on dMsg.net, fostering genuine engagement and decentralization.

## How Proof of Link (PoL) Works

1. To get started, register a username to activate your dMsg.net profile page.
2. Minting begins when someone visits your profile and sends you a message.
3. Accept the message request to establish a connection and complete the minting process—you'll earn mining rewards!
4. Each unique connection between users generates only one reward.
5. The initial reward is **1 DMSG**, and rewards halve every **21 million** blocks.
6. Mining ends when rewards reach **0.0001 DMSG** at block height **293,999,999**, capping the total supply at **41,997,436.32 DMSG**.
7. There's no pre-mined DMSG—all tokens are generated through PoL mining.

Registering a username on dMsg.net costs at least **100 PANDA**, and creating a message channel costs **10 PANDA**.
