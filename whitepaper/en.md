# ICPanda DAO Whitepaper

> A decentralized Panda meme brand built on the Internet Computer.

## Introduction

ICPanda DAO represents a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) committed to advancing the Panda meme brand within the decentralized ecosystem of the Internet Computer. As a DAO, it operates with a community-driven approach, leveraging the Internet Computer's blockchain technology to foster an environment of transparency, autonomy, and collaborative decision-making.

## Vision and Mission

We will have pandas in Web3, and we will have pandas in the metaverse. Let's make it happen: building a decentralized Panda meme brand on the Internet Computer now, and make it the pandas of the future.

## Internet Computer Overview

The [**Internet Computer**](https://internetcomputer.org/) (IC) integrates autonomous serverless cloud functionality into the public Internet. This advancement enables the creation of virtually any system or service on a decentralized network, utilizing 'canister software'—an evolved form of smart contracts.
Web3 services and enterprise systems can be directly built on the Internet Computer—a scalable public decentralized network. It is capable of hosting social networks, media streaming, and more, offering Web3 functionality. These services are tamper-proof and can interact with the outside world in a trustless manner.

## Main Offerings

### Lucky Pool System

Users can obtain PANDA tokens through airdrops for free, which allows them to participate in panda culture NFT creation and other Web3 activities without any barriers; users can also acquire PANDA tokens through lucky draws, ensuring a more equitable distribution of PANDA tokens.

### Panda Badges System

The panda badge is an image SFT (Semi-Fungible Token) officially produced by the ICPanda DAO. Users can purchase panda badges with PANDA tokens, allowing them to display their virtual panda identity on social networks, media streaming, and other Web3 platforms.

### Panda Culture NFT Creation And Trading Platform

Users can create and trade panda culture NFTs on this platform, which can be in various forms such as images, videos, 3D+AI virtual objects, etc. Users need to spend PANDA tokens to list their NFT works, which are priced in ICP tokens. Users can stake PANDA tokens to boost the exposure of other users' NFT works, and earn a share of the profits when those NFT works are sold.

### Decentralized and Open Panda Meme Brand Platform

This platform is built on the RWA (Real World Asset) concept, aiming to introduce panda culture and related brands from Web2 and offline entities into Web3, or bring original panda culture from Web3 to Web2 and offline entities. This includes but is not limited to the digital avatars of real pandas, panda culture merchandise, derivative movies, and games. The platform aims to globalize panda culture by fostering open cooperation and facilitating traffic exchange both online and offline.
